        Each angel is meticulously built by hand so that no two are exactly alike, and have their own unique personality.
        They are ready to be shared with family and friends to offer comfort, love, sympathy and more.

        Lacybpottery recently expanded our line to include candles!
        Our candles are made from the finest soy wax and hand poured into our stoneware containers.
        They are actually 2 gifts in one!
        After the candle has burned down,
        clean out the container and use it as a functional serving piece!
