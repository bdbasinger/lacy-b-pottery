  <h1 class="callout-title">About Us</h1>
  <div class="callout-copy">
    <p>
      LacyBPottery was born out of the Basinger family's love for their patriarch's pottery, Bill Basinger.
      While attending Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, Bill enrolled in several art and ceramic classes.
      Upon acquiring his masters degree in the early 1960's,
      Bill remained in Muncie for several years teaching others about the craft and trade of ceramics.
      Later on his life, he settled in Little Rock, Arkansas, and opened up a pottery workshop in his home.
      At the ripe old age of 88, he continues his passion to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill has passed on his knowledge to his son, David; his daughter-in-law, Lacy;
      and his grandchildren, Brennan, Meredith, Mary Frances, and Jessi.
      Continuing the family tradition started by Bill,
      David and Lacy opened a studio of their own in the fall of 2016 in Grenada, Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      David enjoys throwing on the wheel, and Lacy prefers the art of hand-building.
      Their children, Brennan, Meredith, Mary Frances and Jessi all contribute to the work as well.
      All of LacyBPottery’s stoneware is oven, microwave and dishwasher safe.
      Every piece of Lacy’s hand-built designs is one of a kind, which makes each of them a wonderful, unique gift.

  <h2>LacyBPottery Products</h2>
  <p>
    LacyBPottery is made in Grenada, MS. All of our pottery is either hand-thrown or hand-built,
    and our glazes are hand painted. We sell our products from our studio, at La Bella Fonte Galleria in Grenada,
    at Fluer De Lis in Starkville, MS, and at The Mustard Seed in Oxford, MS. Although we do not sell our pottery
    directly from the website, we try to keep our website up to date with photos of new inventory.
    For regular updates on new products and information on exclusive giveaways, please consider joining our
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2000631226855457/" target="_blank">Facebook group.</a>

      Lacybpottery recently expanded our line to include candles!
      Our candles are made from the finest soy wax and hand poured into our stoneware containers.
      They are actually 2 gifts in one!
      After the candle has burned down,
      clean out the container and use it as a functional serving piece!
